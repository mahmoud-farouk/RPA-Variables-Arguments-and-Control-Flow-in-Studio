# RPA-Variables-Arguments-and-Control-Flow-in-Studio
in htis workflow project, I Created a simple interest calculator using a separate workflow and arguments

I Created a simple interest calculator. In My ‘Main’ workflow, asked the user to enter the amount of the initial deposit and the period (multiple choice, e.g. 1 year, 3 years, 5 years).  I Stored the input in two variables. Afterwards, I created a third variable that will store the value of the final earning.

then I Create a new workflow and use it to calculate a simple interest using the user input and token into consideration the value of the rate/year. Afterwards, I display on screen the cumulated interest at the end of the period and the final deposit balance.
